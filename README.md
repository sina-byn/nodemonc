Have you ever wondered how Nodemon reloads a Node.js process whenever a file changes? Let’s explore it together by building our own version, which we’ll call “nodemonc” (short for nodemon clone).

### Getting Started
#### Prerequisites
- Node.js
- npm or yarn

#### Installation

1. Clone the repository :

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/sina-byn/nodemonc.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory :

```bash
$ cd nodemonc
```

3. Install dependencies :

```bash
$ npm install
# or
$ yarn install
```

#### Running the Application
